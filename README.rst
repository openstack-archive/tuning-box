Features
--------

ConfigDB entities:

- Environment
- Component
- Hierarchy level
- Resource definition
- Resource value
- Resource value override

Installation
------------

#. Download Tuning Box RPM package or code to the Fuel Master node. The
   package can be built from the source code using::

    $ python setup.py bdist_rpm

#. Tuning Box installs as a Fuel Nailgun extension. Therefore, perform the
   DB migration and restart the Nailgun service::

    $ nailgun_syncdb
    $ systemctl restart nailgun.service

#. Configure the Tuning Box keystone service::

    $ export OS_USERNAME=admin OS_PASSWORD=admin OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin OS_AUTH_URL=http://10.20.0.2:5000
    $ openstack service create --name tuning-box config
    $ openstack endpoint create --publicurl http://10.20.0.2:8000/api/config --region RegionOne tuning-box

Now, you have enabled a set of ``config`` commands in the ``fuel2`` CLI.

Commands groups for fuel2 CLI
-----------------------------

The ``fuel2`` CLI commands groups are the following:

- ``config comp`` - CRUD operations for components
- ``config def`` - CRUD operations for resource definitions
- ``config env`` - CRUD operations for environments
- ``config get``, ``config set``, ``config del`` - CRUD operations for
  resource values
- ``config override``, ``config rm override`` - operations for resource values
  overrides

API
---

For all operations authentication is required. Auth token should be passed in
the X-Auth-Token HTTP header. Tuning Box installed as a Fuel Nailgun extension
thus base API URL is placed at ``http://MASTER_NODE_IP:8000/api/v1/config``
All operations URLs should be concatenated with the base API URL.

Components operations
=====================

URL: ``/components``
Operations:

- (POST) component creation
- (GET) list components

For adding component POST:
.. code-block:: python

{
  'name': str,
  'resource_definitions': [
    {'name': str, 'content': str}
  ]
}
